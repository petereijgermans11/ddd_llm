### (Summary) ProRail: Responsible for the Dutch Railway Network

ProRail is tasked with managing the railway network in the Netherlands. We work tirelessly, day and night, to ensure that passengers and goods reach their destinations safely and on time. This is achieved in collaboration with transport operators and certified railway contractors.

#### **Key Responsibilities**

1. **Railway Maintenance**  
   Continuous upkeep of the tracks to ensure safety and efficiency.

2. **Railway Renewal**  
   Modernizing and replacing outdated railway infrastructure.

3. **Capacity Allocation**  
   Each August, we finalize the allocation of railway capacity following a period of planning and intensive consultations. Transport operators then schedule trains and staff to enable the new timetable, which comes into effect every December.  

4. **Train Traffic Coordination**  
   The Operational Control Center Rail (OCCR) in Utrecht serves as the national hub for managing the daily operations of the Dutch railway network. The OCCR brings together ProRail staff, freight and passenger transport operators, and railway contractors to:  
   - Resolve disruptions.  
   - Keep train traffic moving inside and outside affected areas.  

   **Train Traffic Management**  
   Traffic controllers work 24/7 to direct train movements safely and efficiently. During disruptions, they implement OCCR's national coordination at a regional level. By controlling switches and signals, they ensure optimal train flow. ProRail operates twelve traffic control centers across the Netherlands, each overseeing its designated area. These centers monitor train movements, respond to disruptions, and minimize their impact.

5. **ICT Systems**  
   Effective communication systems are essential for ProRail. Our planners use proprietary systems to design schedules, which train traffic controllers rely on to communicate with train drivers. These systems also ensure seamless coordination during incidents, involving train traffic controllers, drivers, incident responders, and emergency services.  

   **Software and Applications**  
   ProRail develops and manages software tools in collaboration with IT partners. These include applications for monitoring train movements, operating switches, adjusting schedules, and coordinating during incidents. We also develop systems for optimal planning of maintenance and construction projects.

6. **Incident Management**  
   Our Incident Control Officers (ICOs) collaborate with various parties to handle incidents. For example:  
   - Assisting transport operators in evacuating stranded passengers.  
   - Working with the fire brigade in case of fires.  
   - Coordinating with railway contractors to repair damaged infrastructure.  

7. **Rail Freight Transport**  
   The Dutch railway network facilitates significant freight movement, much of which crosses borders to destinations across Europe.

8. **Nature Management**  
   As one of the largest green space managers in the Netherlands, ProRail maintains vegetation along the tracks to prevent disruptions to train traffic.

9. **Railway Projects**  
   ProRail is committed to continuously improving the railway network. This includes projects such as replacing level crossings, modernizing stations, and enhancing overall infrastructure.
